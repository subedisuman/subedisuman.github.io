excerpt: "My opinion on the coronavirus situation, what long lasting impacts it may have in our lives."

It is the 1st of April, 2020 but it is no joke. The pandemic coronavirus is creating havoc, an unprecedented generational crisis as large as the adjacent WWII in terms of the sheer scale of global effect. More than 60,000 people are dead, more than a million people globally infected among which 4-5 percent are in severe life-threatening conditions and rest going through the mild yet painful disease. Extremely painful and heartbreaking, at this moment, it is seminal for us to show our warmest compassion and support to our fellow affected companions helping heal our physical and emotional wounds. Equally important is to gaze into the long term consequences of the crisis, the yet overlooked aspects of our new lives that may stay for a while or even forever. I am attempting to explore such long term consequences in this blog post.

#### **The premise**

The virus is everywhere, at least in everyone's fear. Hitting the developed nations of Europe and North America hard it has made an unique mark. Up until the post, most of Asia, Africa, and South America are spared to brace for the foreseeable wave, with only some part of east Asia making a mark with some hopeful recoveries. It has shut down our schools, our institutions, our societies, our families, basically everything that makes us unique as a species. 

#### **Human's greatest nemesis**

Humans, as we are at the top in the evolutionary battle is credited to our uniquely equipped cognitive prowess. On the opposite side of the ring is an unintelligent yet the strongest nemesis of ours which is yet only controversially a living being. It is incredible to muse how the most advanced of the organism as we humans have the most primitive of the conceivable life-form as our strongest nemesis. The strongest nemesis because it somehow strangely knows our greatest strengths, our human spirit of coalition that brings about families, societies, and nations that it knows how to hit hard, really hard.

#### **The moment to validate**

Cut off from friends, families, mentors, events, societies, we are now weaker as a collective unit. To the credit of the internet, we are only weaker not totally dysfunctional. The moment is strange and vastly uncertain. We do not know what changes lie ahead. Uncertain it may be but the same uncertainty makes it a unique once in a generation opportunity. The opportunity to validate. Validate our personal, family, societal, national and global priorities. It is not that difficult in my opinion. We do not have to mindlessly search for the priorities that we can adjust. It is right among us; we are living through them. We just need to recognize them and take action.

#### **Reduced consumption and cleaner environment**

Reduced emission due to reduced traffic levels is an obvious immediate consequence of the pandemic. Traffic levels in the affected cities are down lowering emissions of carbon monoxide due to vehicles by a significant number. New York, has seen a drop in CO emission due to vehicles by 50% for a couple of days during its lockdown. There have been suggestions of 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period during the nationwide lockdown. Good news?

Not so much. Traffic levels, however, are not the only culprits of air pollution. Power plants and factories are still operating as essential businesses. Also, by all means, these drops in pollution level are due to the fact that our economy is running crippled. The crippled economy cannot sustain the existing infrastructures. Stimuli are needed to recover the economy to a stable equilibrium. Experts even argue that potential urgent stimulus to recover economic growth would mostly be regardless of the impact on the environment. It is scary. 

Yes. But one valuable realization the pandemic has made clear is that the correlation between our consumption and pollution levels is stark. Adjustments to our consumption pattern does help recover the environment. What we need to do now is to notice the differences we make to our environment and ponder what we can in fact do. There are few things we can do that takes only slight effort from our part. Minimalistic lifestyle, lowering consumption of non-essential goods, resorting to public transportation whenever possible, recycling and reusing more often, etc. will definitely help thoroughly and would also help establish an environment-conscious public opinion that goes deep along generations as collective habit. These are slight micro changes in our luxuries and comfort that bring about huge macro differences in economic sustainability.

#### **Pandemic proof infrastructure**

Essential business and non-essential business, the businesses divided at the time of crisis. Absolute necessary business that can run the human capital in idle are essential business. The so-called non-essential businesses are the ones that continuously sustain and sporadically boost our economy. Most of the non-essential businesses are curbed at this moment. People are closing them. We are closing them. A huge sacrifice in our part, in my opinion. We are setting aside our individual personal and professional duties and desires for the protection of us, everyone basically. Pretty venerable stuff.

Still, we have to run as much of the non-essential businesses as possible. One aspect of it is replacing face-to face interactions required for the businesses with remote interaction facilitated via strong IT infrastructures. Online learning platforms for schools and universities, remote working platforms for as many businesses as possible not only cover as a functional backup in the time of a pandemic but also help save valuable resources be it in transportation or real estate, every day.

Not all workplaces have remote alternatives, however. But there are still possibilities. New workplaces needs to be designed taking striker priorities and protocols for pandemic response into consideration. Establishing infrastructures to plan, track, and communicate measures and real-time progress in a workplace, regular pandemic exercises and drills, etc. are few ideas among many.

Emerging technologies also have a big role to play. Autonomous vehicles can be a good fit in these circumstances as an autonomously operated ambulance network, for example. Autonomous testing booths and stations can help free up valuable medical personels from repetitive scalable tasks allowing them to focus on more complicated tasks of taking precise care of severely ill. There are countless possibilities that only imagination and resources can limit.

#### Internet **and surveillance**

Certainly, the pandemic has to end at some point. Hopefully soon, a new normal will come, a transitional stage with it. In the transition stage comes the question of the range and magnitude of ease of lockdown regulations. The question of safety against security has come knocking especially in the transitional stage. Governments are proposing plans to ease regulations against the so-called non-essential business that belongs voluntarily or compulsary compromise of privacy from citizens' part. Some countries have in fact already taken such measures to a favorable effect: tracking movement through cell phones. To what extent that is arguable and to what extent preposterous is beyond the scope of this discussion. But I would argue, internet and social media are in some way unfairly criticized. They brought about huge positive changes in how we live and how we can choose to live which are indeed permanent and irreversible changes so there are not many options than to simply adapt, wisely.

#### **Underappreciated research community**

Health care, energy, transportation, finance, technology, etc. everything that drives today's convoluted economy is the product of visionary researchers who worked hard a half decade or so earlier. Countless changes along the way, now, one can argue research communities are underappreciated. Somehow there are not enough healthy and fair incentives for researchers and creators in the existing structure. The discussion circles back to bureaucracy and democracy. In this specific case, I might be complaining too much or it can also be a false intuition on my part. But, I would like to take a benefit of doubt. A better model to incentivize the core of the economy of the future is an important enough topic to summon in political discussions.

At last what I would like to say is that the current situation has given some of us an ample amount of time to ponder. Thinking that the normal way of our lives we are so used to seems to be elusive makes me realize that there might be countless further possible instances of changes that the pandemic can bestow upon us that we can not even imagine at the moment. I guess that is what makes this moment so uncertain. But I would like to look at this time through a rare optimistic rather cliched lens. Regardless of everything, let us all think about it as an opportunity. An opportunity to explore adjustments that we would not even think about in normal circumstances regardless of how urgent they actually were.
