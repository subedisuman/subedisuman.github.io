It is the 1st of April, 2020 but it is no joke. The pandemic coronavirus is creating havoc, an unprecedented generational crisis as large as the adjacent WWII in terms of the sheer scale of a global effect. More than 60,000 people are dead with more than a million people globally infected among which 4-5 percent are in severe life-threatening conditions and others going through the mild yet painful disease. It is extremely painful and heartbreaking. At this moment, it is seminal to show our warmest compassion and support to our fellow affected companions helping heal our physical and emotional wounds. It is however equally important to gaze into the long term consequences of the crisis, the things that may stay for a while or forever. I am attempting to explore such long term consequences in this blog post.

#### **The premise**

The virus is everywhere, at least in everyone's fear. It has hit the developed nations of Europe and North America hard, up until the post sparing most of Asia, Africa, and South America to brace for the foreseeable wave, with only some part of east Asia making a mark with some hopeful recoveries. It has shut down our schools, our institutions, our societies, our families, basically everything that makes us unique as a species. 

#### **Human's greatest nemesis**

Humans, as we are at the epoch in the evolutionary battle is credited to our uniquely equipped cognitive prowess. On the opposite side of the ring is an unintelligent yet the strongest nemesis of ours which is yet only controversially a living being. It is incredible to think about how the most advanced of the organism as we humans have the most primitive of the life form as our strongest nemesis. The strongest nemesis because it somehow strangely knows our greatest strengths, our human spirit of coalition that brings about families, societies, and nations and knows how to hit them hard, really hard.

#### **The moment to validate**

Cut off from friends, families, mentors, events, societies, we are now weaker as a collective unit; to the credit of the internet, it is only weaker not totally decapitated. However, we can come out of the situation with positives. The moment is strange and vastly uncertain. We do not know what changes lie ahead. But the same uncertainty makes it a unique once in a generation opportunity. The opportunity to validate. Validate our personal, family, societal, national and global priorities. It is not that difficult I think. We do not have to mindlessly search for the priorities that we can adjust. It is right among us; we are living through them. We just need to recognize them and take action.

#### **Reduced consumption and cleaner environment**

Reduced emission due to reduced traffic levels is an obvious immediate consequence of the pandemic. Traffic levels in the affected cities are down lowering emissions of carbon monoxide due to vehicles by a significant number. New York, has seen a drop in CO emission due to vehicles by 50% for a couple of days during its lockdown. There have been suggestions that a 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period during the nationwide lockdown. Good news?

Traffic level, however, is not the accurate measure of air pollution. Power plants and factories are still operating as the essential businesses contributing to pollution. Also, by all means, these drops in pollution level are credited to the crippled economy which is, however, unstable and fleeting. The crippled economy during a pandemic can not sustain the existing infrastructures. Stimuli are needed to recover the economy to a stable equilibrium. Experts even argue that potential urgent stimulus to recover economic growth would mostly be regardless of the impact on the environment. It is scary. 

But one thing the pandemic has clearly shown us is that the correlation between our consumption and pollution levels is stark. Adjustments to our consumption pattern can help recover the environment for good. It is also for us every individual to notice the difference we make to our environment and ponder what measures can we take in an individual level. Minimalistic lifestyle, lowering consumption of non-essential stuffs, taking public transportation when possible, recycling and reusing more often, etc. could be the ways that will help to establish an environment-conscious public opinion that goes farther along generations. These are slight micro changes in our luxuries and comfort that bring about huge macro differences in economic sustainability.

#### **Pandemic proof infrastructure**

The pandemic has divided business into essential business and non-essential business. The essential businesses are the ones that can run our human capital in idle. The so-called non-essential businesses are the ones that continuously sustain and sporadically boost our economy. Most of the non-essential businesses are curbed at this moment. People are closing them. We are closing them. It is a huge sacrifice in our part in my opinion. We are setting our individual personal and professional duties and desires aside for the protection of our vulnerable. We should be thanking ourselves for our sacrifices. But I think we are better than that. 

Also, there must come a transition between the current state of emergency and a new normal. Then it begs an important question of how and how much of the so-called non-essential businesses can we run safely in the transition period. One obvious aspect to the question is remote work via strong IT infrastructures. Online learning platforms for schools and universities, remote working platforms for as many businesses as possible can not only provide a functional backup in the time of a pandemic but also help save valuable resources be it in transportation or real estate every day. 

Not all workplaces have remote alternatives, however. But there are still possibilities. One can when building a new workplace take stricker priorities and protocols for pandemic response into consideration. Establish infrastructures to plan, track, and communicate measures and contact with potentially infected employees in a workplace. Regular pandemic exercises and drills, etc.. are few ideas among many.

Emerging technologies have a big role to play in future infrastructures. Autonomous vehicles can be a good fit in these circumstances as an autonomously operated ambulance network. Autonomous testing booths and stations can help free up valuable medical human resources from repetitive tasks steering them to more complicated tasks of taking precise care of the severely ill. There are countless possibilities that only imagination and resources can limit.

#### Internet **and surveillance**

In transition from the state of emergency to a new normal, we ought to explore the middle ground. Here comes the question of safely vs security. Governments are proposing measures to let the regulations against so-called non-essential business loose that has something to do with voluntarily or compulsary compromise of privacy. Some countries has in fact already taken such measures to a favorable effect: tracking people's movement through their cell phones and social media connectivity. To what extent that is arguable and to what extent preposterous is beyond the scope of this discussion. But I would argue, internet and social media are in some way unfairly criticized. They brought about huge positive changes in how we live and how we can choose to live. These changes are indeed permanent and irreversible so there is not much option than to adapt.

#### **Underappreciated research community**

Health care, energy, transportation, finance, technology, etc. everything that drives today's convoluted economy is the product of tiring research and innovation in a university quarter or a garage somewhere 50 or so years earlier. Still, one can argue that research communities are underappreciated in our social system. Somehow there are not enough healthy and fair incentives for researchers and creators in the existing political circumstance. The discussion circles back to bureaucracy and democracy. In this specific case, I might be complaining too much or it can also be a false intuition in my part, but I would like to give a benefit of doubt here. A better model to incentivize the core of the economy of the future is an important enough topic to summon in public discussions.

Pondering that the normal way of life we used to live seems to be so elusive makes me realize there are countless possible instances of changes that the pandemic can bestow upon us that we can not even imagine at the moment. I guess that is what makes this moment so uncertain. But I would like to look at this time through a rare optimistic lens. Let us all think about it as an opportunity. Opportunity to explore adjustments that we would not even think about in normal circumstances regardless of how urgent they actually were.
