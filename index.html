<h2>About me</h2>
<h3>Professional overview</h3>
<p>
I am pursuing MSc Aerospace at TUM with focus on Dynamics, Control, and Computation mostly in application to real-time systems, system development, and safety. I have worked on making autonomous UAV with <a href="https://nicnepal.org/projects/medical-drone.html">NIC, Nepal</a> for medicine delivery and further more.
Please refer to my  <a href="/assets/Suman_Subedi_CV.pdf">RESUME</a> for more detail.

<h3>Personal overview</h3>
<p>
I love reading, mostly nonfiction genre: history, philosophy, humor, business productivity. 
A good musical piece can make my day. I love to listen to western classical music for inspiration, 
eastern classical for purity, progressive rock when I feel low, and pop while I am commuting. 
I can play percussion instruments fairly well and try to play guitar. Am a fan of well designed music, books, movies, presentations, posters, websites and what not that serves their purpose really well with a touch of shrewdness.
