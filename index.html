<p>This is Suman Subedi. I am an Aerospace Master student at TUM. 
Fond of science and history in general, my academic interests revolve around Dynamics, Control, and Computation in application to 
Autonomous Systems, System Development and Safety. I worked on making hands-on Autonomous UAV with 
<a href="https://nicnepal.org/projects/medical-drone.html">NIC, Nepal</a> for medicine delivery, 
keeping myself busy in pair of volunteer activities in Nepal, 
my home country.</p>
<p>Besides, I am also fond of Music and Content Creation. 
    I am a basic level percussion player, can give okayish background vocals, and love to draw and 
    make digital art. My definition of a productive day is sitting in front of 
    computer -not consuming-, forgetting to eat and sleep, and dreaming to go for a jog. 
    Love discussing philosophy and current affairs in Nepalese and English, and also making 
    everyday-chitchat in German.</p>
